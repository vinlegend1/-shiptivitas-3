Near the start to middle of the time span, we had users but the users weren't using our features. Probably because the features at the time were so bad(i.e. there was no cohesiveness, no priority, no real system to quickly determine which to ship first and last) that it drived users to not use it. Our brand might've become notorious for being bad and leading to a spike of users for somewhere in the middle. When the new features were implemented (i.e. shiptivitas-1, shiptivitas-2 backend), there was an increase in change of status. I think the overall daily users would steadily increase and plateau at a value, and our changes in status would definitely increase steadily and plateau at a value from the last recorded value. (Unless we implement another good feature that would separate us from the competition)
